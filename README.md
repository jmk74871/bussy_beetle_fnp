# Folder Prefix CLI Tool

This is a command-line tool for adding or removing a folder name as a prefix to file names. It supports both processing files in the top-level folder and recursively in subfolders.

## How to Use the Executable

### Download and Setup

1. **Download the Executable**: Download the latest version of the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo-name/releases) section of this repository.

2. **Place the Executable**: After downloading, place the `.exe` file in a folder of your choice or add it to your systemâ€™s PATH to use it globally.

### Running the Tool

1. **Open a Terminal**: Open the command prompt or PowerShell.

2. **Navigate to the Folder**: If the executable is not in your system's PATH, navigate to the folder where you placed the `.exe` using the `cd` command.

   Example:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\executable

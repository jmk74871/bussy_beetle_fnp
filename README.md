# Folder Prefix CLI Tool
This is a command-line tool for adding or removing a folder name as a prefix to file names. It supports both processing files in the top-level folder and recursively in subfolders.

How to Use the Executable
Download and Setup
Download the Executable: Download the latest version of the executable from the Releases section of this repository.

Place the Executable: After downloading, place the .exe file in a folder of your choice or add it to your systemâ€™s PATH to use it globally.

## Running the Tool
Simply download the .exe file and double click it. You might need to confirm that you actually want to run this program.

### Follow the Prompts: After running the program, you will be prompted for the following inputs:
Folder Path: Enter the full path of the folder you want to scan. You can obtain this by opening the folder in the 
file explorer, rightclicking it in the path menu bar and selecting 'Copy Path'.

Action (Add or Remove Prefix): Choose whether to add or remove the folder name as a prefix.
Subfolder Traversal: Choose whether to include subfolders in the operation. The prefix applied will allways be the name of the top level folder.

## Requirements
Operating System: Windows
Permissions: The tool requires read and write access to the folder and files you want to modify.

### Notes
The executable works only on Windows machines.
Ensure that you have the correct permissions to rename files in the directory.
